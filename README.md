# Trying-Out-Vanilla-JS

Just some HTML code and JS scripts, in an attempt to learn integrating JS with HTML.
I used [this reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ResWVWI333o "YouTube | JS for web-designers") to get started with JS.

*Also, [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "MDN | JS") are vv helpful.*
